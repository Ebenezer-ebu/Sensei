- It should only answer questions that are crypto related, nothing else
- Ability to produce images / graphs will be an added advantage

- Ability to answer questions about a user’s trade history and pattern on Roqqu is an added advantage (api to retrieve a user’s trade history will be made available on request)

## How to use
- By default you can it can response only to crypto related questions when you type in the input field.
- You have some already made demo questions to try out.
- Ability to produce images (I made it dynamic, you will need to switch to the DELL-E-3 or DELL-E-2). Can be done by setting at the side navigation
- You can from the setting make other settings to your own liking.
